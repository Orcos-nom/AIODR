## **How It Works**  

1. The ESP32 microcontroller establishes a Bluetooth connection with the mobile app.
2. Commands sent via the app control the movement of the rover (forward, backward, left, right).
3. The ESP32-CAM captures live video, streaming it to a Python processing unit.
4. Using OpenCV and NumPy, the video frames are processed and fed into the YOLOv8 model.
5. Detected objects are labeled and visualized in real-time on the mobile app or display.
