# AIODR {artificial intelligence object detection rover}

#Bluetooth-Controlled Object Detection Rover
This project features a versatile rover that can be operated via a mobile app using Bluetooth. Powered by the ESP32 microcontroller, it combines robotics and AI to deliver object detection capabilities. The onboard ESP32-CAM module captures real-time video, and with the help of Python libraries like OpenCV, NumPy, TensorFlow, and YOLOv8, it processes and detects objects with high accuracy.

Features
.Bluetooth Control: Operate the rover seamlessly using a mobile app.
.Object Detection: Leverages YOLOv8 for real-time object detection.
.Camera Integration: Uses the ESP32-CAM module for live video feed and image processing.
.AI-Powered Processing: Implements advanced machine learning models (TensorFlow, YOLOv8) for efficient detection.
.Python Backend: The detection algorithms are built using Python 3 with OpenCV and NumPy for preprocessing and analysis.

Technologies Used
.ESP32 Microcontroller: Handles Bluetooth communication and controls the rover's motion.
.ESP32-CAM: Captures video and streams it for object detection.
.Python 3: For implementing detection and image processing algorithms.
.OpenCV & NumPy: For video frame manipulation and preprocessing.
.TensorFlow & YOLOv8: For object recognition and classification.

Applications
.Educational robotics and AI projects.
.Surveillance and monitoring systems.
.Autonomous navigation and object interaction.
